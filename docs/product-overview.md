# Product Overview

## CORELINE Smart Spine Corset

CORELINE is a next-generation spinal support system designed to improve posture, reduce spinal load, and support healthy movement during everyday life, work, and sport.

Unlike traditional orthopedic corsets that rely on rigid immobilization, CORELINE uses a **biomechanically optimized, adaptive structure** that supports the spine while preserving natural mobility.

## The Problem

Millions of people experience chronic back discomfort caused by:

- Prolonged sitting and poor posture
- Repetitive physical stress at work
- Insufficient spinal stabilization during sport
- Overly rigid or uncomfortable support devices

Most existing solutions fall into two extremes:
- **Soft posture correctors** with limited effectiveness
- **Rigid medical braces** that restrict movement and comfort

CORELINE is designed to bridge this gap.

## The CORELINE Solution

CORELINE Smart Corset provides:

- Dynamic spinal support without full immobilization
- Intelligent load redistribution along the lumbar and thoracic spine
- Adjustable compression adapted to individual needs
- Lightweight, breathable construction for long-term daily wear

The result is a system that supports posture **without forcing it**.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Adaptive Support, Not Rigidity
CORELINE follows the body’s movement while applying controlled resistance where needed.

### 2. Layered Biomechanical Architecture
Each layer performs a dedicated function: support, compression, comfort, and breathability.

### 3. Everyday Wearability
Designed to be worn:
- At work
- During commuting
- During light to moderate physical activity
- Throughout daily routines

### 4. Future-Ready Platform
CORELINE is built as a modular system, allowing future integration of sensors and mobile applications without redesigning the core product.

## Target Users

CORELINE is intended for:

- Office workers and remote professionals
- People experiencing non-clinical back discomfort
- Athletes during training and recovery
- Individuals seeking posture improvement
- Users requiring long-term ergonomic support

Initial versions are positioned as **wellness and performance support devices**, with medical certification planned for future iterations.

## How It Works (High-Level)

1. External structural layers distribute load across the torso
2. Internal support elements guide spinal alignment
3. Adaptive compression stabilizes posture
4. Breathable inner layers ensure comfort
5. (Future) Sensors analyze posture and movement patterns

No active electronics are required for the core biomechanical function.
