## What is CORELINE Smart Spine Corset?

CORELINE Smart Spine Corset is a wearable spinal support system designed to assist posture and reduce excessive mechanical strain on the spine during daily activities, work, and light to moderate physical movement.

It is not a rigid medical brace, but a biomechanically informed support garment intended for comfortable, extended wear.

---

## Is CORELINE a medical device?

No. CORELINE is **not classified as a medical device** and does not replace medical treatment, diagnosis, or professional therapy.

It is designed as a **supportive and preventative solution** for posture assistance and everyday spinal comfort.

Users with diagnosed medical conditions should consult a healthcare professional before use.

---

## Who is CORELINE designed for?

CORELINE is suitable for:
- Office workers and remote professionals
- Individuals experiencing posture-related discomfort
- Physically active people and athletes
- Users seeking preventative spinal support
- People looking for improved posture awareness

It is not intended for acute injuries or post-surgical rehabilitation without medical supervision.

---

## How does CORELINE work?

CORELINE works by:
- providing distributed support across lumbar and thoracic regions
- encouraging neutral spinal alignment
- reducing peak pressure points
- supporting natural movement rather than restricting it

The design assists the body without forcing immobilization or excessive compression.

---

## Does CORELINE weaken back muscles?

No. CORELINE is specifically designed to **avoid muscle dependency**.

Unlike rigid braces, it allows natural muscle engagement while offering external support where needed. Users can adjust support intensity based on activity level.

---

## Can I wear CORELINE all day?

CORELINE is designed for extended daily use. Breathable materials and ergonomic design help maintain comfort during prolonged wear.

However, individual comfort may vary. Users are encouraged to gradually increase wear time and adjust fit as needed.

---

## Is CORELINE suitable for sports and exercise?

CORELINE is suitable for:
- light to moderate physical activity
- fitness training
- warm-ups and recovery sessions

It is not intended for high-impact or extreme sports unless explicitly validated in future testing phases.

---

## Does CORELINE include electronics or sensors?

The initial version of CORELINE is a **purely passive support system** with no electronics or sensors.

The design includes optional architecture for **future modular smart components**, such as posture monitoring sensors and mobile app integration. These features are not required for basic functionality.

---

## Will there be a mobile app?

A mobile application is planned for future iterations as an optional enhancement.

The core product does not depend on software or electronics and functions independently.

---

## How is CORELINE different from existing posture correctors?

CORELINE differs by:
- focusing on load redistribution rather than forced posture correction
- prioritizing comfort and breathability
- avoiding rigid structures
- supporting movement instead of restricting it
- being designed for real-world, daily use

---

## What materials are used?

CORELINE uses a combination of:
- advanced breathable mesh textiles
- flexible reinforcement zones
- adjustable tension components

Future versions may evaluate advanced materials such as thermoregulating fabrics or high-performance composites, subject to testing and validation.

---

## Is CORELINE adjustable?

Yes. CORELINE includes adjustable elements that allow users to customize fit and support intensity based on body type and activity level.

---

## What sizes will be available?

Sizing options are currently under development.

Our goal is to offer a range of sizes suitable for different body types, with clear fitting guidance provided before product release.

---

## When will CORELINE be available?

CORELINE is currently in the **prototype and development stage**.

The Indiegogo campaign aims to fund:
- advanced prototyping
- material validation
- biomechanical testing
- pilot manufacturing

Estimated timelines will be shared in the project roadmap.

---

## How will the funds be used?

Funds raised through Indiegogo will be allocated to:
- product development and testing
- material sourcing and validation
- tooling and pilot production
- certifications and compliance preparation

Full transparency will be maintained through project updates.

---

## Will CORELINE be open-source?

CORELINE follows an open documentation approach.

Design concepts, research references, and development progress are shared publicly. Certain manufacturing details may remain proprietary to ensure product viability.

---

## Can CORELINE help with back pain?

CORELINE is designed to support posture and reduce strain, which may improve comfort for some users.

It does not claim to treat, cure, or prevent medical conditions. Individual results may vary.

---

## How can I stay updated?

Updates will be shared via:
- Indiegogo campaign updates
- GitHub repository
- Official social media channels
