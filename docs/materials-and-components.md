# Materials and Components

CORELINE is engineered with a focus on comfort, durability, breathability, and biomechanical efficiency.

Material selection prioritizes:
- low weight
- high air permeability
- skin safety
- long-term wear comfort

## Structural textile layers

### Advanced breathable mesh
The primary body layer uses a high-strength, breathable mesh fabric commonly applied in sports compression wear and orthopedic supports.

Properties:
- excellent airflow
- moisture-wicking
- low thermal retention
- soft contact with skin

This allows CORELINE to be worn for extended periods without overheating or discomfort.

## Load-distribution elements

Instead of rigid frames, CORELINE uses **flexible reinforcement zones** positioned according to spinal biomechanics.

These zones are designed to:
- support lumbar and thoracic regions
- distribute load across a larger surface area
- reduce peak pressure points
- maintain freedom of movement

---

## Adaptive tension system

An adjustable tension system allows users to fine-tune support intensity based on activity level.

This ensures:
- dynamic support rather than constant compression
- adaptability for sitting, standing, and movement
- reduced risk of muscle over-reliance

---

## Optional advanced materials (future iterations)

Future research may include evaluation of:
- high-performance polymer fibers
- thermoregulating textiles
- aerogel-enhanced insulation layers (selective zones)
- antimicrobial and hypoallergenic coatings

All materials will be validated for safety, durability, and real-world usability.

## Sustainability considerations

Material selection also considers:
- longevity
- replaceable components
- reduced material waste
- scalable manufacturing processes
