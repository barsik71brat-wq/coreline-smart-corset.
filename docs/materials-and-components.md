# Materials and Components

## Layers (example stack)
- Soft inner liner (moisture-wicking textile) — for comfort
- Adaptive aerogel-like smart foam — changes stiffness under load
- Carbon-fiber reinforcement strips — longitudinal support
- Elastic tensioning straps — for fit adjustment
- External breathable shell — abrasion resistance and shape

## Electronics (Sensor Edition, optional)
- IMU (6-axis) for posture angle detection
- Pressure sensors for load distribution mapping
- BLE module for smartphone connectivity
- Small haptic motor for gentle reminders
- Low-power MCU and battery (rechargeable)
