# Biomechanics and Design Principles

The design is based on widely accepted biomechanics:
- Distribute compressive load across wider surface area to reduce focal stress on vertebral discs.
- Support lumbar lordosis and thoracic alignment without forcing rigid posture.
- Use semi-rigid reinforcements that transfer load to textile structure and hip/pelvic supports.
- Preserve mobility: allow range of motion for functional activities (walking, squatting).
