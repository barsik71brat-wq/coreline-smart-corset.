# Biomechanics and Design

CORELINE is designed around fundamental principles of human spinal biomechanics.

## Biomechanical foundation

The human spine is not a rigid structure — it requires:
- controlled mobility
- balanced load distribution
- muscular engagement

Excessive rigidity can weaken stabilizing muscles over time.

CORELINE aims to:
- assist posture
- reduce excessive strain
- maintain natural movement patterns

---

## Load redistribution concept

By applying distributed support across lumbar and thoracic regions, CORELINE:
- reduces localized stress
- supports neutral spine alignment
- improves postural awareness

---

## Design constraints

- No forced immobilization
- No excessive compression
- No dependency-based support model

The system is designed to **support — not replace — natural biomechanics**.
