# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current development plan for the CORELINE Smart Spine Corset.

All timelines represent estimated targets based on current information and are subject to change as development progresses.

---

## Phase 1 — Prototype refinement and validation

**Status:** In progress

Goals:
- refine ergonomic design
- evaluate material combinations
- improve comfort and fit
- validate biomechanical assumptions

Activities:
- iterative prototype adjustments
- internal wear testing
- feedback-driven improvements
- documentation updates

---

## Phase 2 — Advanced prototyping and testing

**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- develop advanced functional prototypes
- conduct extended wear tests
- assess durability and long-term comfort
- validate support effectiveness

Activities:
- multi-material prototype builds
- stress and movement simulations
- user testing across multiple body types
- refinement of adjustment mechanisms

---

## Phase 3 — Pre-production engineering

**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- prepare manufacturing-ready designs
- finalize material specifications
- optimize assembly processes
- evaluate tooling requirements

Activities:
- design for manufacturability (DFM)
- supplier communication and sourcing
- cost optimization
- quality control planning

---

## Phase 4 — Pilot production

**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- produce a limited pilot batch
- validate manufacturing workflow
- perform final quality checks
- prepare packaging and logistics

Activities:
- small-batch manufacturing
- quality assurance testing
- packaging prototyping
- logistics planning

---

## Phase 5 — Certification and compliance preparation

**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- assess regulatory requirements
- prepare compliance documentation
- ensure product safety standards

Activities:
- material safety evaluations
- labeling and documentation preparation
- compliance strategy finalization

---

## Phase 6 — Fulfillment and delivery

**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- begin fulfillment to backers
- collect post-delivery feedback
- prepare next production cycle

Activities:
- logistics coordination
- shipment execution
- user feedback collection
- post-launch support

---

## Future development

Beyond initial fulfillment, future development may include:
- optional smart sensor modules
- mobile application integration
- advanced data analytics
- expanded product variants

These features are not required for core functionality and will be developed independently as optional enhancements.

---

## Transparency commitment

Development progress, challenges, and adjustments will be shared openly through:
- Indiegogo updates
- GitHub documentation
- official communication channels

Our goal is to build CORELINE responsibly, transparently, and sustainably.
