# CORELINE Smart Spine Corset

## Redefining posture — for sport, work, and everyday life.

CORELINE is an open-development project focused on creating a **next-generation spinal support system** that combines biomechanics, advanced materials, and future smart integration.

---

## Mission

Our mission is to develop an adaptive spinal support system that improves posture, reduces unnecessary spinal load, and empowers healthier movement — built transparently and collaboratively.

---

## What Is CORELINE?

CORELINE Smart Corset is a lightweight, breathable, and modular spinal support device designed to:

- Support lumbar and thoracic alignment
- Reduce fatigue from prolonged sitting or standing
- Assist posture during daily activity and sport
- Evolve into a smart wearable platform over time

The system works mechanically first — sensors and software are optional future layers, not dependencies.

---

## Project Status

CORELINE is currently in the **prototype and validation phase**.

This repository serves as:
- Technical documentation hub
- Open design reference
- Development log
- Community collaboration base

Funding is being raised via Indiegogo to support further development and production readiness.
