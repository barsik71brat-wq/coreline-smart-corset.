# CORELINE Smart Spine Corset

## Redefining posture — for sport, work, and everyday life.

CORELINE is a next-generation spinal support system designed to reduce back strain, improve posture, and support healthy movement in everyday life, sports, and work environments.

This project combines biomechanics, advanced materials, and future-ready wearable technology to create a lightweight, breathable, and adaptive corset that distributes spinal load naturally — without rigid braces or forced immobilization.

## Why CORELINE exists

Millions of people experience chronic or episodic back pain due to:
- prolonged sitting and office work
- physical labor and repetitive strain
- sports and fitness activities
- poor posture habits formed over time

Most existing solutions are either:
- too rigid and uncomfortable
- medically intimidating
- unsuitable for daily or active use

CORELINE is designed as a **modern alternative**: supportive, discreet, breathable, and adaptable.

## Project overview

CORELINE Smart Spine Corset is an open-development hardware and software project focused on biomechanically optimized spinal support.

### Key design principles:
- Natural load redistribution across lumbar and thoracic regions
- Lightweight, breathable, skin-friendly materials
- Modular architecture for future sensor integration
- Comfort suitable for all-day wear
- Usable for medical, lifestyle, and sports contexts

The initial version focuses on **passive biomechanical support**.  
Future versions will introduce optional smart modules for posture analytics and personalized feedback via mobile applications.
