# CORELINE Smart Corset

**Mission**  
Our mission is to create an intelligent, research-based spinal support system that improves daily life, empowers healthier movement, and grows through open development and global collaboration.

**Project overview**  
CORELINE Smart Corset is an open-development hardware + software project focused on biomechanically optimized spinal support. The project aims to produce a lightweight, breathable corset that supports the lumbar and thoracic spine during work and sport, with future sensor integration for posture analytics.

**What this repository contains**  
- Technical documentation (hardware, firmware, app)  
- Research and biomechanics references  
- Roadmap, funding allocation and development log  
- Media assets and renders (placeholders)

**Indiegogo Campaign**  
We are preparing an Indiegogo campaign (CORELINE_Team / Smart Spine Corset) with a funding goal of **$100,000** USD. This repository and open documentation are part of our commitment to transparency and community-driven development. Once OSC hosting is confirmed we will publish financials and updates via the host.
